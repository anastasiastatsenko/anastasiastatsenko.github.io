            <h1>Big Tech monopolies, privacy and the cost of free. </h1>
            <br><br>
            In a world where most experiences are rapidly commodified, the social becoming increasingly commercial and performative, I believe that there is untapped potential for (web and visual) designers to contribute to wider societal transition for mutual thriving, prioritising mental and ecological wellbeing, and creating platforms for further change. My project will take a small step in this direction by creating an activist web intervention that explores the intersecting topics of BigTech monopolies, privacy and the cost of free. I echo Richard Stallman and the FLOSS (Free Libre Open Source Software) movement in reorienting our attention from "free" as in "without a price," to "free" as in "freedom". 
            <br><br>
            While there are many resources available on making more sustainable choices and lifestyles, not many of them address the digital world (aside from emptying your email or adding an accessibility widget to your website). Today's crises (housing, food, climate, land, social) are interconnected, and our physical and digital worlds also deeply so—in many ways they coproduce each other. 
            <br><br> 
            As a small step towards investgating this complex relationship, I want to challenge people to think about the ways their online habits contribute to and maintain exploitative power dynamics responsible for the degradation of our planetary ecologies. A two week digital cleanse and a prompt return to doom scrolling is not a solution. Instead, I will point them towards educational resources and practices they can adopt in order to challenge the despiriting myth that the only way to fight back against Big Tech's omnipotence is to opt-out (from social media, from a cellphone, from society).  
            <br><br><br>
            <h2>Technology is political - not neutral.</h2>
            <br><br>
            If you care about your bank and educational institution divesting from fossil fuels, if you choose to eat plant based or take public transport, if you thrift, try to consume less and buy ethically made products whenever possible, why wouldn't you also care about having a more ethical digital ecosystem? There is immense potential for positive change when scaling individual habits, and the choices we make about the digital products and services we use are no exception. 
            <br><br>
            Originally, "The National Science Foundation Network explicitly limited Internet use to non-commercial purposes," however in the 1990s with the prevalence of neoliberal free-market rhetoric and lobbying power of major corporations, the market invaded the web.<sup><a href="http://www.ijcte.org/vol9/1156-TS0057.pdf" target="_blank">1</a></sup> The web we know today is in a constant battle between its intended potential as a noncommercial refuge for decentralized collaboration and knowledge-sharing, and its reality as a massive billboard and check-out line too seductive to effectively regulate. 
            <br><br>
            In theory, the web works for the public, for anyone, connecting us to loved ones, uplifting marginalized voices, and making lifesaving innovation possible. In practice, it brings in over $300 billion in digital advertising revenue for Big Tech, which through intellectual monopoly capitalism mechanisms makes itself indispensable to governments, military powers, healthcare providers, academic institutions, and other services that populations depend on.<sup><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/risk-and-resilience/our-insights/the-consumer-data-opportunity-and-the-privacy-imperative" target="_blank">2</a></sup> This increases Big Tech's power and influence over how society is structured and lives are experienced, which is dangerous considering that they are not often held socially or environmentally responsible for their harmful impacts, and that the punishment of paying a multimillion dollar fine is becoming less and less of a meaningful consequence. While there are many positive uses of the web today, many of them are at threat of extinction if we do not address Big Tech's overreach. 
            <br><br>
            When using the term Big Tech, I refer to the tech giants like Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Meta (Facebook, Instagram), Microsoft, and Apple. These US companies are largest and wealthiest, for example: Google controls 70% of the global search market and 97% of searches on mobile devices, Microsoft runs on 90% of computers worldwide, and Apple's iTunes has 87% market share of digital music downloads.<sup><a href="http://www.ijcte.org/vol9/1156-TS0057.pdf" target="_blank">3</a></sup> Google is the number one most visited site with 85.1 billion visits, followed by Youtube and Facebook. Amazon holds 50% market share in ecommerce in the US, though worldwide it is dwarfed by Chinese Alibaba, and Amazon Web Services holds a majority 31% market share of global cloud computing services.<sup><a href="https://financesonline.com/amazon-statistics/" target="_blank">4</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/18819/worldwide-market-share-of-leading-cloud-infrastructure-service-providers/" target="_blank">5</a></sup> Outside the US, only China's Baidu, Aliababa, Tencent, and Xiaomi hold a similar level of influence.  These empires are known though many acronyms  (FAANG, GAFAM, BATX) but in my opinion, the term Big Tech best captures their power, global status and the strategy of monopoly capitalism that fuels their operations. This trend in consolidation and dominance in Tech is not dissimilar to, and works in tandem with the same phenomenon in other industries, which you might call Big Finance, Big Pharma, Big Oil, and Big Media. So where does their power really come from? How does it work? 
            <br><br>
            <h3>
            "Internet giants like Facebook and Google leverage networks of domination made possible, in part, by the users themselves, who willingly open the door to the exploitation of their digital footprint. Citizens invest a large part of their social capital, of their time, in this cyber-world; this investment serves to finance these companies and, in so doing, deepen their control and facilitate the emergence of an increasingly powerful technocracy." <sup><a href="http://www.ijcte.org/vol9/1156-TS0057.pdf" target="_blank">6</a></sup></h3>
            <br><br>
            In her theory of Digital Colonialism, Iranian artist and cultural critic Moreshin Allahyari explores the "tendency for information technologies to be deployed in ways that reproduce colonial power relations," and the internet is no exception.<sup><a href="https://morehshin.com/digital-colonialism-2016-2019/" target="_blank">7</a></sup> If the internet is the latest frontier, then Big Tech companies are the brave explorers propelled by the promise of endless wealth.  In their hands, the online landscape turns to immaterial capital to be captured, analyzed, repackaged and sold for profit. Knowledge is instrumentalized as intellectual property, and promptly privatized through aggresive patent buy-outs.<sup><a href="http://www.ijcte.org/vol9/1156-TS0057.pdf" target="_blank">8</a></sup> Creativity and competition are subjugated through "acquisitions to gain market power, acquire data, and snuff out any threats," as shown by the American Economic Liberties Project that tracks Big Tech mergers from the last 30 years.<sup><a href="https://www.economicliberties.us/big-tech-merger-tracker/#" target="_blank">9</a></sup> Big Tech co-authors hundreds of scientific studies a year with academic and institutional partners, and reaps all the profits. <sup><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4va-JedZGQA" target="_blank">9</a></sup> The most popular areas of research : big data and machine learning algorithms. Why?
            <br><br><br>
            <h2>Because their biggest profit-generating stream is you.</h2>
            <br><br>
            Collecting, storing, analyzing and monetizing personal data though targeted advertising is Big Tech's bread and butter, and there is no limit to the type of information they collect, often unknowingly to the user (when was the last time you really read the entire Terms and Conditions before installing that free app?) Your hardware specs; browser, apps and programs installed; timestamps of when you are online; most visited websites (including what you click on, how long you look at something, what you add to cart, where you go next); your searches; your downloads; your purchase history are all mined. More scarily: your location; age; income; education and profession; your close friends and acquanitances; race; sex, gender, sexuality; credit score; cellphone provider; email and its contents can be collected. 
            <br><br>
            "Seen individually, the pieces of data are mostly inconsequential and harmless. But taken together, they provide what investigators call a profile - a clear picture of a person's habits and preferences, and indeed, of his or her life," and millions of these profiles aggregated into big data sets provide insights into entire populations and demographics.<sup><a href="https://www.zeit.de/digital/datenschutz/2011-03/data-protection-malte-spitz" target="_blank">10</a></sup> Even if not explicitly given, much information can be accurately inferred and tracked using MAIDs (mobile advertising identifiers) and other cross-referencing tools to match it to your unique personal consumer profile, and even to your real-life identity.<sup><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/module/mobile-phones-location-tracking" target="_blank">11</a></sup> 
            <br><br>
            This can be used to predict your hobbies and preferences,  who you are dating, if you are pregnant, whether you vote conservative, your genetic risk factors, your likelihood of success or of committing a crime. It can be used to confirm a radical activist's presence at a protest, reveal a journalist's confidential source, increase a smoker's insurance premium, take away a disabled woman's benefits, or keep white neighbourhoods white by showing racially-biased demographic-specific housing ads. 
            <br><br><br>
            <h2>Who is this data sold to?</h2>
            <br><br>
            Anyone that can benefit from it by "improving" their product of service: advertising agencies, governments, insurance companies, tech and software firms, drug corporations, military and law enforcement, financial institutions, academic labs, social media platforms, digital service providers, ISPs, scammers.
            <br><br>
            <b>Some more terrifying examples of what big data algorithms can be used for include:</b><br><br>
            <div class="inset">
            1. <b>predictive (read: racist) policing</b> which assigns 'threat scores' to individuals and neighbourhoods<sup><a href="https://privacyinternational.org/examples/1808/new-way-police-are-surveilling-you-calculating-your-threat-score" target="_blank">12</a></sup><br><br> 
            2. <b>social monitoring programs</b> that violate platform policies, mine personal data from social media (like Meta and X), and are then used to surveil protesters and other 'people of interest' without their knowledge or consent by state police<sup><a href="https://nysfocus.com/2023/01/13/state-police-social-media-surveillance-including-dataminr-shadowdragon-geofeedia/" target="_blank">13</a></sup><br><br>
            3. <b>misinformation campaigns</b> that arbitrarily change headlines, target radicalized demographics, undercut journalism and publishing, and undermine public education and safety<br><br>
            4. <b>buying elections</b><br><br>
            5. <b>censoring</b> and deciding what content is 'appropriate' for viewers (ironically without filtering drug, pornography and other illegal services from their sites), what words are banned, whose accounts are seen (or invisible)<br><br>
            6. <b>algorithmic rent-setting</b> which exacerbates the housing crisis and leads to higher eviction rates<sup><a href="http://www.economicliberties.us/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Policy-Memo-Rent-Setting-Software-Algorithms.pdf" target="_blank">14</a></sup><br><br>
            7. <b>gender-biased rating</b> that assigns women as higher credit risks than their husbands, despite them having higher incomes or credit scores<br><br> 
            8. <b>government tracking</b> of individuals and groups of people using wifi, bluetooth, mac addresses, or cell site simulators
            </div>
            <br><br>
            Additionally, there have been cases where Big Tech knowingly insecurely stored sensitive user data, and/or shared it without consent with third parties, and many more documented cases of compromising data leaks that put people's safety and livelihood at risk. Many more times when Big Tech has lied, including Google tracking users in Incognito mode, and Alexa/Siri listening in on private conversations even when turned off. These and many more case studies can be explored in more detail on the <b><a href="https://www.economicliberties.us/big-tech-abuse-tracker/#" class="blue" target="_blank">American Economic Liberties Project</a></b> that tracks Big Tech Abuses.
            <br><br><br>
            <h2>Governments (particularly the US and China) are increasingly dependent on the success of Big Tech. </h2>
            <br><br>
            They "rely on them for policymaking, ... surveillance, contact tracing apps, national statistics agencies, cloud services," and even healthcare.<sup><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4va-JedZGQA" target="_blank">15</a></sup>In return, Big Tech receives multimillion dollar subsidies from governments for data center infrasture projects essential to their activities.<sup><a href="http://www.economicliberties.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Working-Paper-Series-on-Corporate-Power_6.pdf" target="_blank">16</a></sup> These use immense amounts of energy, create few jobs and local economic development opportunities, and can have devastating environmental an biological impacts. <sup><a href="http://www.ijcte.org/vol9/1156-TS0057.pdf" target="_blank">17</a> </sup><sup><a href="https://www.goodjobsfirst.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/pdf/datacenters.pdf" target="_blank">18</a></sup> And yet, while "stagnation and crisis are emblematic of a monopoly capitalism system," research shows that during periods of crisis, while governments struggle to support their citizens and small business to make ends meet, Big Tech firms are the most resilient, even turning a profit.<sup><a href="https://academic.oup.com/cje/article/46/6/1205/7033410" target="_blank">19</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://theconversation.com/your-personal-data-is-the-currency-of-the-digital-age-146386" target="_blank">20</a></sup> 
            <br><br>
            <h3>"With their widening global reach, digital platforms have created the modern equivalent of a serf, appropriating and monetising the digital footprint of the daily lives of people drawn and locked into these platforms." <sup><a href="https://academic.oup.com/cje/article/46/6/1205/7033410" target="_blank">21</a></sup></h3>
            <br><br>
            When you pay with your personal data, the cost is not free. By paying with your oersonal data, you concentrate power in the hands of Big Tech as they exercise more and more influence over economies, resource extraction, labour conditions, markets, politics, law enforcement, and environmental impact on a planetary scale. Many of the difficulties in addressing this issue lie in the increasing complexity and black-box nature of technologies designed to keep users dependent on Big Tech for "solutions" to their problems. Many governments (notably the EU) and nonprofits like the American Economic Liberties Project are working to improve policy and regulation on a systemic level, by "strengthening anti-trust interventions, enforcing equal access rules, structural separations, and inter-operability standards."<sup><a href="https://academic.oup.com/cje/article/46/6/1205/7033410" target="_blank">22</a></sup> But I believe that personal choice matters too, and while we can't always be perfect or succeed at 100% de-googling our lives, we can all contribute to making a difference. My project will provide a gateway into further resources to explore privacy best-practices like using VPN, secure email, messaging and browsers, applications without trackers, cutting out Big Tech wherever possible, questioning convenience and use of social media, supporting FOSS and FLOSS projects and maybe even contributing to some! My hope is that after using my site, people would be interested enough to investigate further, and be able to explain the importance of this topic to anyone - even their technologically-challenged grandma.  
            <br><br>
            For people who argue that "they have nothing to hide," and so privacy is of little concern, I would direct them to Privacy International's extensive research on why privacy rights are relevant on both individual and societal scales. Through case studies, they argue that privacy "ensures our rights are respected and protected", allows us "to take part in our community's culture", and "to work with dignity". It "limits how data can be used against us", "helps us defend ourselves", "facilitates access to justice", and "ensures the law is applied in the same manner to everyone". Privacy protects our right to education, our standard of living, our right to rest, our free elections, our access to social security, our freedom of thought, our right to protest, our beliefs, marriage equality, our property, those fleeing from persecution, our ability to move freely, our bodily autonomy, and our lives. "Without it, we cannot assert our equality, autonomy and dignity".<sup><a href="https://privacyinternational.org/learning-resources/privacy-matters" target="_blank">23</a></sup> 
            <br><br>
            My website, Personal Secret Agent is inspired by these complex issues, but focusses instead on a smaller scale and uses first-person point of view in order to be relatable to the average person. Privacy rights and ethical data management are not only essential to challenging Big Tech on a systemic level, but also intimately intertwined with the daily lived experience of billions of people. By breaking down complex information into a game-like ASMR experience I hope to reach people on an emotional level, inspire them to go out and learn more, have more conversations, and make whatever changes they can to fight back for a better internet and a better future! Remember, you control what technologies you use and how you use them, not tech giants that strongarm you with "convenience" to use what they make available. 
            <br><br>
            <h3>"Whenever someone tells you that privacy is dead, they're just wishcasting. What they mean is: “If I can convince you privacy is dead, I can make more money at your expense.”  <sup><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/03/privacy-first-and-competition" target="_blank">24</a></sup></h3>
