            <p><span class="quote">He urges that men of science should then turn to the massive task of making more accessible our bewildering store of knowledge. Now, says Dr. Bush, instruments are at hand which, if properly developed, will give man access to and command over the inherited knowledge of the ages. (page 1)</span>
            
            Even in 1945, Bush already notes the "growing amount of research" that is piling up as a result of increasing specialization. Although access to information is growing, access to knowledge is not, since processing the data is becoming too overwhelming. This rings even more true today. Now, with commodification threatening the promises of the web, <span class="bold"> data has become the fetish object of late capitalism. </span> Data collection is driving how we design, find, navigate, and use websites, and legislation on ethical collection and use of personal data is a topic of central concern. It's incredible to me that often what is being discussed as in need of protection is as ephemeral as a person's digital footprint: what they look at on a webpage (shoes?), where they click (add to cart?), where they go next (a competitor's site?), where else they linger (social media accounts?), how much they make, how much they spend, how they are likely to vote, where they travel, who they work for, who they love... 
            <br>
            <br>
            Per Marx's definition of commodity fetishism: data leaves the realm of use-value (the practical function it serves) and enters that of abstract capital, or exchange-value (how much money it's worth on the market). Additionally, with data, physical (human) labour is erased and the commodity takes on life of its own (through algorithms, AI). Magical powers are inscribed on objects created through capitalist production; here, data is knowledge, data is power, data is what will save us all.
            <br>
            <br>
            Not only do we have a mysterious, obsessive attachment to data, but it is central to Western modernity. It's used to justify and support contested political boundaries, and those of social class, gender, identity and race in a world threatened by economic upheaval, social agitation, colonial exploitation and competition, and movements of resistance. <span class="bold">We look to data to provide us with answers, meaning, direction, and decision making, but the real nature of data and its power are obscure.</span> It is touted as a panacea for most issues in business, politics, ecology, environment, and the emerging field of data science and data analysis is rapidly expanding in scope and influence. It's becoming not only trendy but almost necessary to have a data analyst on corporate teams. Data is also a huge factor that drives capitalist progress and expansion, not only in its actual representation of statistical facts and figures, but in the rational and scientific worldview that it naturalizes as not only most effective, but the only sane option. It overshadows, discredits, and in some cases erases other ways of knowing, like indigenous epistemologies and embodied relational worldviews.
            <br>
            <br>
            To relate this back to Bush's article, I think he had an innovative vision, incredible in imagination and scope, but he didn't include much in the way of warnings, or oppositional views of what such a technology would look like in a world that still has many disbalances of power. <span class="bold">Today, I think it's essential to look at the ways in which we produce and reproduce knowledge, communicate, create, and relate to one another online with a critical eye.</span> Especially to the ways that the online world interconnects with the physical, and the ways in which it reproduces unequal power relations - so that we can change it for the better.

                <p><span class="quote">The human mind ... operates by association. With one item in its grasp, it snaps instantly to the next that is suggested by the association of thoughts, in accordance with some intricate web of trails carried by the cells of the brain. (page 14)</span>
                
                In this section it seems to me that Bush is describing <a href="linksbaby.html" target="_blank">links!</a> I found it really interesting how clearly he seems to be describing computers and network culture, although at the time of writing no such thing existed yet. But maybe it seems like the "obvious" explanation to me because of the context in which I'm reading the article (web design course). 
                <br>
                <br>
                His observation about associative thinking reminds me of a pattern I'm noticing: more and more applications are providing alternatives to the tree hierarchy of folders (the common way UI are organised on Windows, Mac, etc.). <span class="bold">Instead, they offer a "linking your thinking" approach to file and personal knowledge management.</span> Obsidian, the highly customizeable open-source markdown text editor that I use to store all of my notes and files is an example of this. Instead of information being stored under one name and in one place, using a combination of naming conventions, hastags and links, it can exist in a web of relationships with other information, much like in my brain. It can be called upon, searched, and found in many ways, most commonly with simple queries. I can also integrate pdfs, images, audio, and code among other things, and because it is a local open-source program based entirely in markdown, my information is at no risk of loss if the program ceases to exist or gets monetized. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <span class="bold">In many ways (and because I mainly use Obsidian for research and coursework), it reminded me a lot of what Bush envisioned the memex to look like!</span> Bush's memex is a mechanized device that stores a person's books, records, and communications, which can be consulted very quickly and intimately supplements their memory (page 15). Although, his later descriptions of sending information directly into our brains and manipulating content that hovers on translucent screens reminded me more of VR development, especially the creepy advertisements of <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/guided-tour/" target="_blank">Apple's Vision Pro.</a>
                <br>
                <br>
                Another offhand observation I had while reading the article is that the word "keyboard" is much older than I thought.

                <p><span class="quote">When numerous items have been thus joined together to form a trail, they can be reviewed in turn, rapidly or slowly, by deflecting a lever like that used for turning the pages of a book. It is exactly as though the physical items had been gathered together to form a new book. It is more than this, for any item can be joined into numerous trails. (page 16)</span>
                
                Here, the gathering and curation of materials sounds a lot like a newsfeed, but the concept of gathering, ordering and presenting disparate information from many sources under one heading is now so ubiquitous that it's hard to imagine it as an innovation. Almost everything on the web is an example of what Bush writes about speculatively, from articles to listicles to youtube recommendations to repositories, blogs, and wikipedia entries.
                <br>
                <br>
                When Bush writes that the trails do not fade, he is on to something. Uploading content online can be a risk, because once the data is out there, it can be reproduced, downloaded, and stored, often without our consent, and it can be impossible to erase it completely. 
                <br>
                <br>    
                Bush has an idealized version of what the web could be for the "thinking man," and while in many cases the web has been revolutionary for democracy and education, today I think we see many issues that need to be addressed as corporations and governments fight for control over web infrastructure, and concerned individuals continue to advocate for ethical use and access to the web for all.
                <br>
                <br>    
                Another thing I think Bush doesn't foresee is the spread of misinformation. Since access to the web gives a platform to anyone, the ability to critically interpret and verify sources is brought to the forefront. With the rising complexity of technology, empirical evidence is brought into question, just as much as the credibility of the author, and legitimacy of their claims.

                    <p><span class="quote">Presumably man's spirit should be elevated if he can better review his shady past and analyze more completely and objectively his present problems. He has built a civilization so complex that he needs to mechanize his record more fully if he is to push his experiment to its logical conclusion and not merely become bogged down part way there by overtaxing his limited memory. (page 19)</span>
                    
                    As technology grows more complex, Bush's call to keep "mechanizing the record" remains a dominant solution to addressing change. The answer is always: better, faster, technology, more advancement.  
                    
                    However, I think that focussing only on rapid technocentric development as the main solution to humanity's "present problems" is misguided, much like adding more freeways does not improve traffic congestion, but actually clogs the streets with more and more vehicles. It's also interesting to note how Bush vaguely refers to technological progress as "man's experiment," I'm sure there's a lot to unpack there!
